2 new colors appear after level 4. 

Goals to accomplish:
-Not sure if I want to fix the css. It might throw people off if the blocks move from their base. Thats why its off center
-Make it mobile responsive
-Sounds for orange and purple colors
-Rickroll effect after level 10 as to say "Player won"
